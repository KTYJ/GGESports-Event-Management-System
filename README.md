# GGESports Event Management System
This web application is a Society and Event Management System that allows administrators to manage events and participants. Administrators can create, update, and delete events, and manage bookings. Participants can register, log in, browse events, search for them, buy tickets or join free events, and view their booking records. The system uses a MariaDB database and supports basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for events and bookings. It also enables secure user authentication and authorization, with a PHP backend for server-side logic and interaction with the database.

# How to Run

2. After Installation, go to the path **C:\xampp** _(your installation directory)_ and locate **xampp-control.exe**.
